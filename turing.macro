 -> jump to the state containing your command
 -> or fail if it doesn't exist
/         -> start search
^s\s\+{ -> line starting with [state] {
\_[^}]*   -> no closing braces
(c)     -> the command wrapped in parentheses
\_[^}]*   -> no closing braces
}         -> a closing brace starting a line
        -> enter (to start the search)

 -> now we are know the bracketed group we are in contains
 -> so we are safe to jump to the specific command more
 -> niaively
/(c)  -> jump to command
/ : ww  -> jump to the first subexpression
