" A program to add one to a binary number
" list of registers that will be used
" p - the macro that runs the program
" s - the state of the turing machine
" l - one step of the main loop
" c - the individual command used to look up the action
" a - the action that will be performed
" f - a sub macro that finds the action to be and copies it to reg a

= reg p (for program)
GoANSWERggOREAD-10"sy$dd@l
GoANSWERggOREAD-10"sy$dd@l

Breakdown:
GoANSWER     -> write answer at the bottom of the file
gg             -> go to beginning of file
OREAD-1      -> write one the initial state
0"sy$          -> store it in reg s
dd             -> delete the line written out
@l             -> start the main loop


= reg l (for main loop)
0"cy$l@fh@a

Breakdown:
0"cy$    -> yank the command into c
l@f    -> jump to the right window and execute f
h@a    -> jump to the working window and execute the action

= reg f (for find command)
/^s\s.*c.*:f:ll"ay$j0"syE

Breakdown:
/^s\s.*c.*:  -> search for state followed by specific command
f:ll"ay$           -> yank the action into reg a
j0"syE             -> yank the next state into reg s
