" A program to add one to a binary number
" list of registers that will be used
" p - the macro that runs the program
" s - the state of the turing machine
" l - one step of the main loop
" c - the individual command used to look up the action
" a - the action that will be performed
" f - a sub macro that finds the action to be and copies it to reg a

= reg p (for program)
ggOCARRY-ONE"sy$dd@l

Breakdown:
gg             -> go to beginning of file
OCARRY-ONE   -> write one the initial state
"sy$           -> store it in reg s
dd             -> delete the line written out
@l             -> start the main loop


= reg l (for main loop)
"cy$l@fh@a

Breakdown:
"cy$     -> yank the command into c
l@f    -> jump to the right window and execute f
h@a    -> jump to the working window and execute the action

= reg f (for find command)
/s.*c.*:f:ll"ay$

Breakdown:
/s.*c.*:  -> search for state followed by specific command
f:l"ay$         -> yank the action into reg a
